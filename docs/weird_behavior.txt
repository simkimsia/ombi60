git ignore
==========

can have multiple git ignore files
if we want to ignore all BUT a few exceptions
we need to first do ignore all

*
followed by other lines of
!foo.html

so put together they mean ignore all but !foo.html

for folders we need to put slash infront
/foldername

flash upload
============
never never use flash uploadify with debug kit turned on at same time.
just turn debug = 0 for debug kit


phpthumb + capistrano
=====================
apparently, because of the symlink for current folder, 
phpthumb will not work. so we must set var $config_allow_src_above_docroot = true;

transactions
============
if we use saveAll for transactions, we need to set atomic = false
transactions will not restore auto increment!!

saveAll
======

**when we want to do edit for both parent and child data AT SAME TIME,

we need to set $parentModel->id = $parent_id;
we need to set $data['Parent']['id'] = $parent_id;
we need to set $data['Child']['id'] = $child_id;

**when we want to mass update existing entries,

we need to set individual entries id like this
        Array
	(
            [CartItem] => Array
            (
                   [2] => Array
                    (
                       [product_quantity] => 1
                        [id] => 2
                   )
		
                    [3] => Array
                  (
                       [product_quantity] => 2
                       [id] => 3
                  )
		
	    )
		
	)

and we need to use $this->CartItem->saveAll($this->data['CartItem'])

for new entries, we can simply use $this->CartItem->saveAll($this->data)
