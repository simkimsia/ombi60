git ignore
==========

can have multiple git ignore files
if we want to ignore all BUT a few exceptions
we need to first do ignore all

*
followed by other lines of
!foo.html

so put together they mean ignore all but !foo.html

for folders we need to put slash infront
/foldername

flash upload
============
never never use flash uploadify with debug kit turned on at same time.
just turn debug = 0 for debug kit


phpthumb + capistrano
=====================
apparently, because of the symlink for current folder, 
phpthumb will not work. so we must set var $config_allow_src_above_docroot = true;

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4523602/phpthumb-works-in-development-machine-ubuntu-not-on-server-ubuntu

transactions
============
if we use saveAll for transactions, we need to set atomic = false
transactions will not restore auto increment!!

saveAll
======

**when we want to do edit for both parent and child data AT SAME TIME,

we need to set $parentModel->id = $parent_id;
we need to set $data['Parent']['id'] = $parent_id;
we need to set $data['Child']['id'] = $child_id;

**when we want to mass update existing entries,

we need to set individual entries id like this
        Array
	(
            [CartItem] => Array
            (
                   [2] => Array
                    (
                       [product_quantity] => 1
                        [id] => 2
                   )
		
                    [3] => Array
                  (
                       [product_quantity] => 2
                       [id] => 3
                  )
		
	    )
		
	)

and we need to use $this->CartItem->saveAll($this->data['CartItem'])

for new entries, we can simply use $this->CartItem->saveAll($this->data)

updateAll
=========
NEED to include "'". $newvalue ."'" in the fields params for varchar.
this is because fields params allow literal SQL queries added

Auth
====

since Auth.allowAll can override any Auth settings, always check for this first
if Auth is not working as expected. including git-ignored files like bootstrap.local.php

MySQL and tinyint(1)
====================

if use tinyint(1), cake auto assumes its boolean.
MUST USE     tinyint(2) to store numbers more than just 0 and 1.

Ajax
====

for link
<?php echo $this->Ajax->link(__('Delete', true),
            array('action' => 'delete', $linkId),
            array('confirm'=> sprintf(__('Are you sure you want to delete this link?', true)),
                  'complete' => "afterDeleteLink('$linkId', request.responseText);")
            ); ?>
            
    note the double quotes for the complete callback
    note the single quotes for the variable
    
    params is string linktitle, mixed url, array options, string confirmation message
    
for submit
echo $this->Ajax->submit('Add Link', array('url'=>array('action'=>'add'),
                                        'complete' => "afterAddLink($linkListId, request.responseText);",
                                        'div'=>false));
                                        
    
    note the double quotes for the complete callback
    
    params is string linktitle, array options, where the url is inside the options.
    
HTML and naming of ids and classes
==================================
never ever use dashes inside the names of id or classes
always use underscores. because sometimes these are used
by jQuery and javascript dash means minus.

jquery sortable serialize
=========================
if sortable is used, and you need to send back the order
do not use uuid as id because sortable serialize use dash as delimiter


use cakephp.bee jquery ajax helper and use update=>js_function()

to post back. see admin/links for more info.

linkable
========

To use it just make sure that the parent model has attached it to Behaviors.

pagination across multiple models
=================================

https://mail.google.com/mail/#search/abbas.sanisoft%40gmail.com/12f57833bb324065


multiple checkbox
=================
http://book.cakephp.org/view/1395/options-multiple

single/multiple checkbox in edit
=========================
You cannot use default to check a checkbox - instead you might set the value in $this->data in your controller, $this->Form->data in your view, or set the input option checked to true.

http://book.cakephp.org/view/1402/options-default

transactions and callbacks
==========================

if you do transaction inside afterSave, ensure that the saveAll of the
primary model is done using atomic=>false, validate=>'first', otherwise
the saveAll will fail despite the records safely saved.

TWIG
=====

do realize that for arrays, best not to use keys with dashes in them.

see http://groups.google.com/group/twig-users/browse_thread/thread/934faafaa302f46e

my array is called list. there is a key inside called main-menu which 
points to another array 
{{ list.main-menu.title }} does not work. 
But if i rename my index to main_menu replacing the dash with 
underscore, it will work. 
{{ list.main_menu.title }} works, provided i renamed my index.

Set::remove
==========

it only works for removing first level element

afterFind
=========

need to be careful about assuming the data format in
afterFind operations. the parameter $primary is important
in determining the likely data format

Vendor Lib
==========

Never ever name vendor class or lib class with numbers inside.
