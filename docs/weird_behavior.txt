git ignore
==========

can have multiple git ignore files
if we want to ignore all BUT a few exceptions
we need to first do ignore all

*
followed by other lines of
!foo.html

so put together they mean ignore all but !foo.html

for folders we need to put slash infront
/foldername

flash upload
============
never never use flash uploadify with debug kit turned on at same time.
just turn debug = 0 for debug kit


phpthumb + capistrano
=====================
apparently, because of the symlink for current folder, 
phpthumb will not work. so we must set var $config_allow_src_above_docroot = true;

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4523602/phpthumb-works-in-development-machine-ubuntu-not-on-server-ubuntu

transactions
============
if we use saveAll for transactions, we need to set atomic = false
transactions will not restore auto increment!!

saveAll
======

**when we want to do edit for both parent and child data AT SAME TIME,

we need to set $parentModel->id = $parent_id;
we need to set $data['Parent']['id'] = $parent_id;
we need to set $data['Child']['id'] = $child_id;

**when we want to mass update existing entries,

we need to set individual entries id like this
        Array
	(
            [CartItem] => Array
            (
                   [2] => Array
                    (
                       [product_quantity] => 1
                        [id] => 2
                   )
		
                    [3] => Array
                  (
                       [product_quantity] => 2
                       [id] => 3
                  )
		
	    )
		
	)

and we need to use $this->CartItem->saveAll($this->data['CartItem'])

for new entries, we can simply use $this->CartItem->saveAll($this->data)

updateAll
=========
NEED to include "'". $newvalue ."'" in the fields params for varchar.
this is because fields params allow literal SQL queries added

Auth
====

since Auth.allowAll can override any Auth settings, always check for this first
if Auth is not working as expected. including git-ignored files like bootstrap.local.php

MySQL and tinyint(1)
====================

if use tinyint(1), cake auto assumes its boolean.
MUST USE     tinyint(2) to store numbers more than just 0 and 1.

Ajax
====

for link
<?php echo $this->Ajax->link(__('Delete', true),
            array('action' => 'delete', $linkId),
            array('confirm'=> sprintf(__('Are you sure you want to delete this link?', true)),
                  'complete' => "afterDeleteLink('$linkId', request.responseText);")
            ); ?>
            
    note the double quotes for the complete callback
    note the single quotes for the variable
    
    params is string linktitle, mixed url, array options, string confirmation message
    
for submit
echo $this->Ajax->submit('Add Link', array('url'=>array('action'=>'add'),
                                        'complete' => "afterAddLink($linkListId, request.responseText);",
                                        'div'=>false));
                                        
    
    note the double quotes for the complete callback
    
    params is string linktitle, array options, where the url is inside the options.
